# maudstats
This program fetches statistics from [maud](https://github.com/hamcha/maud)'s database and displays them in an HTML page using [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js).

### Howto

- Edit the (currently hardcoded) URL of Maud's database in `main.hs`  
- `cabal install`  
- Run `run.sh`, or better yet put it as a cronjob somewhere.
